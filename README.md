# **A.S.S.E.T. \- Algorithmic Stock Selection & Estimation Tool**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the A.S.S.E.T. project\! A.S.S.E.T. (Algorithmic Stock Selection & Estimation Tool) is a specialized artificial intelligence designed to assist users in the complex world of stock market analysis. Our goal is to provide a powerful, data-driven tool that can help identify potential investment opportunities, estimate stock performance, and support strategic decision-making for investors and financial professionals.

A.S.S.E.T. is built with a focus on sophisticated algorithmic analysis, historical data processing, and predictive modeling. It is designed to be integrated and utilized within popular data science and AI environments such as **Jupyter notebooks** and **Ollama**, making it an invaluable companion for navigating financial markets directly from your development environment.

## **Current Features**

A.S.S.E.T. currently offers a robust set of features, accessible programmatically within Jupyter and via API/interface through Ollama:

* **Algorithmic Stock Screening:** Apply various pre-defined or custom algorithms to filter stocks based on financial metrics, technical indicators, and fundamental data.  
* **Performance Estimation:** Generate estimations of future stock performance based on historical trends and proprietary models.  
* **Historical Data Analysis:** Analyze extensive historical stock data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.  
* **Portfolio Simulation:** Simulate the performance of hypothetical portfolios using A.S.S.E.T.'s insights.  
* **Customizable Watchlists:** Programmatically create and manage personalized watchlists for stocks of interest.  
* **Data Visualization Utilities:** Provides functions and methods to generate intuitive charts and graphs for complex financial data and analytical results within your notebook or application.  
* **Google Search Integration:** A.S.S.E.T. includes direct integration with Google Search. This will allow the tool to access real-time news, economic indicators, company announcements, and broader market sentiment directly from the web. This integration will significantly enhance A.S.S.E.T.'s ability to provide up-to-the-minute insights and incorporate external, unstructured data into its analysis, complementing its algorithmic core.
